NativeAd Android SDK
===========
The  NativeAd Android SDK facilitates inserting native mobile ads into a ListView or other content stream in your Android application. You can choose one of our pre-built sample formats, reuse your existing content layout, or create a new custom format.

Dependency
===========
NativeAd Android SDK uses the new Google Advertising ID  to identify application users and is not using the legacy  android ID for this scope, to be compliant with the new [Google Play policy](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/6048248). In order to do this, you will have to add [Google Play Service project](http://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html) as a dependency to EANativeAd SDK

Quickstart
===========
